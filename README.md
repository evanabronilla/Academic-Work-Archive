### 🚀 Purpose
I created this archive to:
1. Keep a backup of all my technical schoolwork in one place.
2. Track my growth as a developer from my first "Hello World" to more complex systems.
3. Provide a quick reference for logic and syntax I've used in the past.

### 📝 Disclaimer
Most of these files were created for academic purposes. While some are simple exercises, they all represent my effort to master the fundamentals of software development.
